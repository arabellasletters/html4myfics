Please credit and let me know if you use this workskin, I want to see your creations!

The html does not work straight out of the following code, you'll have to replace the CAPITALIZED portions with your own media. 
You can get this media by uploading it to github and using the raw https (see below) or off of pinterest or another image hosting site
all raw source links if uploaded to github can be made using this template:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOURUSERNAME/REPOSITORYNAME/main/NAME_OF_FILE.MP4_OR_JPEG_OR_WHATEVER
